% Returns the projection matrix for a given set of corresponding 2D and
% 3D points. 

% 'Points_2D' is nx2 matrix of 2D coordinate of points on the image
% 'Points_3D' is nx3 matrix of 3D coordinate of points in the world

% 'M' is the 3x4 projection matrix


function M = calculate_projection_matrix( Points_2D, Points_3D )

% To solve for the projection matrix. You need to set up a system of
% equations using the corresponding 2D and 3D points:

% Then you can solve this using least squares with the '\' operator or SVD.
% Notice you obtain 2 equations for each corresponding 2D and 3D point
% pair. To solve this, you need at least 6 point pairs.
